                <h1>About US</h1>
                <h2>EduCera</h2>
                <p>From school teachers and tutors to homeschoolers and parents, engaged adults are the key to unlocking
                    each child's potential and drive to learn. We empower all kinds of educators to teach kids by
                    providing the best educational resources in any form or device to be used at home, at school, and
                    everywhere in between. Btech is ❤️. College Students who want to become an engineer.</p>
                <p>Educare aims at providing quality content to every student for free. Live classes, video lectures,
                    test series, lecture notes, topics assignment with best questions, dynamic exercises, and much more.
                    Almost 90% content on this App is free and will always be.</p>
                <p>The founder Vednidhi Kumar, Prateek Kumar &amp; Shivam Kumar stands for education for every child
                    irrespective of their economic status.</p>
                <h4 style="text-align: center;"><span>Test Series</span></h4>
                <p>We provide you the best test series for Btech chapters which will be scheduled for a whole year. This
                    test series follows a very logical sequence of Basic → Advance questions.</p>
                <h4 style="text-align: center;"><span>Daily Practice Paper</span></h4>
                <p>Daily Practice is the key to success. Hence we are now providing lectures DPP sheets for Btech(Python
                    Course) The best questions of this sheet would be also discussed in the later video lecture.</p>
                <h4 style="text-align: center;"><span>Typed Notes from Educera</span></h4>
                <p>Sometimes we need neat and ordered study material prepared according to the syllabus of our exam. The
                    content of these not may/may not be the same as PDF handwritten notes. These notes are equivalent to
                    all the material provided by any reputed institute in India which is working in the domain of Btech
                </p>
                <h4 style="text-align: center;"><span>Assignment</span></h4>
                <p>Now, this is something you won't get for free so easily. These Assignments are the best in the
                    industry and follow a very logical sequence of Basic→Advance questions. The cherry on top is that at
                    the end of the Assignment you get a solution too detailed. The Assignment is designed keeping in my
                    mind the syllabus of Btech CSE.</p>
                <h4 style="text-align: center;"><span>PDF Note (Handwritten)</span></h4>
                <p>Though the best notes are those which are written by yourself, at the time due to unavoidable
                    circumstances we urgently need notes which are best in content as well as quality. For this, we have
                    included PDF notes for each chapter. These notes are aligned under Concepts Notes. At times, you may
                    find some differences between video lectures and PDF Handwritten Notes. Kindly Note that some of
                    these notes are not written by us and they are borrowed from the student community.</p>
